<p class="summary">
Designing incremental encoders is as simple as selecting resolution,
choosing whether to include quadrature and index tracks, and setting
the inner and outer diameter of the encoder.
</p>
<p>The outer track of an incremental encoder features a number of radial,
black stripes of equal size. The space between the stripes is the same
width as the stripes themselves. An optional quadrature track is the
next track. </p>
<p>It has the same number of stripes as the outer track, but
is out of phase by half a stripe width so that the direction of
rotation can be detected. An optional third track, the index track,
features a single stripe to index the rotation of the encoder.
</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>
The resolution setting for an incremental encoder determines the number
of black stripes placed on the disc. The number of stripes must be even.
The resolution spinner can be set either by directly editing the text
box and entering an integer, or by clicking the up or down arrow
buttons on the spinner.</p>
<p>If you enter an odd number, the application will automatically pick the
next highest even number. The spinner arrow buttons increment and
decrement the number of stripes by two.</p>

<h2>Quadrature</h2>
<p>
The quadrature track can be added by clicking the Quadrature Track
check box.
</p>
<h2>Index Track</h2>
<p>
Add an index track by clicking the Index Track check box</p>

<h2>Setting Diameters</h2>
<p>
To finish the design you'll also need to <a href="diameters.html">set
the encoder inner and outer diameters</a>.</p>
