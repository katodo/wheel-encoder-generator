<p class="summary">WheelEncoderGenerator creates an encoder disc with a pattern on it that is read by sensors.  The sensors are interfaced with a computer or microcontroller and convert angular motion or position into a digital signal.
The combination of disc and sensors is a rotary encoder (or shaft encoder).  Encoders fall into two categories, incremental (relative) and absolute.</p>
<h2>Absolute Encoders</h2>
<p>Absolute encoders convert angular positions of the shaft into discrete, unique values.  It encodes a binary-based number sequence into black and white squares on the disc.  That is, the encoder disc encodes a number at each distinct position of the shaft.</p>
<p>The resolution of an absolute encoder is the number of distinct angles that can be measured or encoded.  Resolution is directly related to the number of tracks on the encoder disc.</p>
<p>An absolute encoder disc features multiple tracks, one for each bit in the binary word (number) that describes shaft position.  So an encoder with 3 tracks can encode 2*2*2 (2 to the power of 3) or 8 positions.</p>
<p>The means by which the data is encoded onto the disc falls into two categories: <a href="gray.html">Gray Code</a> and <a href="binary.html">Binary Code</a>.</p>
<h2>Incremental Encoders</h2>
<p>An incremental encoder doesn't contain information about shaft position. Instead, it sends signals to indicate motion. The encoder disc contains black and white stripes.  A sensor creates a pulse as the pattern under it moves from black to white. The speed of rotation determines the frequency of pulses.</p>
<p>An incremental encoder that can detect the direction of motion is a quadrature encoder.  A second signal either lags or leads the first signal by 90 degrees to indicate direction of motion.  One way to construct a quadrature encoder is to place a second sensor so that it reads the same encoder stripes, but generates a signal 90 degrees out of phase with the first sensor. In the image below, the top row of encoders shows two sensors placed so that their signals are 90 degrees apart. When one sensor is squarely on a stripe, the other is halfway between stripes.</p>

<p>The other way to construct a quadrature encoder is to make a disc with a second track with stripes that are 90 degrees out of phase with the first track, and then place two sensors side by side along the radius of the disc.  In the picture above, the bottom row of encoders use a quadrature track.  As in the first row, one sensor is squarely on a stripe while the other is halfway between stripes.  But in this case the stripes are 90 degrees out of phase and the sensors share the same radial mounting line.</p>
