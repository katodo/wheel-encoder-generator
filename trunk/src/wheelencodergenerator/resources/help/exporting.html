<p class="summary">You can export your wheel encoder to an image file, too. One never knows when that might come in handy.</p>
<p>Once you've designed an encoder, export it to a PNG image by selecting Export from the <a href="file.html">File menu</a> or click the Export tool in the <a href="tools.html">toolbar</a>.</p>
<p>First a dialog will appear asking you for the size of the image in pixels.
    The value you enter will be used to set the width and height of the wheel image.</p>
<p>Next, a file chooser dialog will appear.  Select the directory/folder where you want to store the image, and type in the name ending with <code>.PNG</code>.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The current version of WheelEncoderGenerator exports only to a PNG file.  Future releases will provide options to select other image formats as well as Postscript and PDF.</p>
