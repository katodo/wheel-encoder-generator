<p class="summary">Gray code is named after Frank Gray and is a numeral system in binary where only one bit differs between successive numbers.  It's also known as the reflected binary code.</p>
<p>When used in absolute encoders, Gray Code ensures that each successive position is represented by a data word differing in only one bit.  For example, with a two-bit encoder, the data words are 00, 01, 11, 10.</p>
<p>In a rotary encoder, it's useful that the first and last numbers in the sequence (00, 10) differ by only one bit as well.  Also, if your sensor is right on the border between two positions, the maximum possible error is one bit, or one position, a feature Gray Code has over Binary Coding.</p>
<p>A three-bit Gray Code sequence is: 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100.  A four-bit sequence takes the 3-bit sequence and reflects it.  The old sequence gets a 0 added to the front and the new, reflected sequence gets a 1 added to the front: 0000, 0001, 0011, 0010, 0110, 0111, 0101, 0100, 1100, 1101, 1111, 1110, 1011, 1001, 1000.  With black representing 0 and white representing 1, the example below illustrates a 4-bit Gray Code absolute encoder.</p>
