<p class="summary">Here are some troubleshooting tips if your encoder prints out too big or too small.</p>
<p>Check the scaling settings in your print dialog and set to 1:1 or 100%</p>
<p>Your printer might not print to exactly the right scale.  If the size is slightly off, measure the printed size (for example, 57mm), divide into the desired size (say, 50mm), and use the result (0.8772) as the scale for printing that you set in the print dialog (88%). Or manually scale the outer diameter and inner diameter with the calculated scale (50 * 0.8772 = 44).  Or just use trial and error.</p>
<p>If your printer is printing out the encoder as an ellipse, that is, wider than long, or longer than wide, unless your print dialog allows scaling each axis (x and y) independently, you'll have to wait for a future enhancement to the program that will allow you to configure print scaling to correct these errors.</p>
