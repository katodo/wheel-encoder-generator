<p class="summary">Designing absolute encoders is as simple as selecting resolution,
choosing whether to use Gray Code or Binary Code, and setting
the inner and outer diameter of the encoder. </p>
<p>An absolute encoder uses multiple tracks with alternating white and black stripes to encode position as a binary value.  The number of bits in the binary value is equal to the number of tracks on the encoder.  White represents 1 and black represents 0 (or vice versa, it really doesn't matter).</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>An absolute encoder's resolution refers to the number of unique
positions encoded in the disc.  The Resolution combo box (pull down
menu) selects the number of positions the encoder will represent. The
values range from 2, 4, 8, 16, ... 4096, or 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 12 tracks.</p>
<p>A 2-position (1-bit) absolute encoder has one track with a black and a white stripe.</p>
<p>A 4-position (2-bit) encoder adds a second track to the 1-bit encoder.
The second track has two black stripes and two white stripes,
representing the pattern 1010. Together the two tracks are positioned
to represent the values 00, 01, 10, 11 corresponding to each of the 4
unique positions.</p>
<p>Each additional bit of resolution adds another track and doubles the
number of positions the encoder can represent. Each track has 2 times
as many black stripes (and white stripes) as the previous track.

<h2>Setting Diameters</h2>
<p>
To finish the design you'll also need to <a href="diameters.html">set
the encoder inner and outer diameters</a>.</p>
