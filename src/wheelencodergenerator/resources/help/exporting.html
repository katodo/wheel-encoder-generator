<p class="summary">You can export your wheel encoder to an image file, too. One never knows when that might come in handy.</p>
<p>Once you've designed an encoder, export it to a PNG, GIF, or JPEG image by selecting Export from the <a href="file.html">File menu</a>
    or click the Export tool in the <a href="tools.html">toolbar</a>.</p>
<p>First a dialog will appear asking you for the resolution (size) of the image in pixels and the file format to use.
The resolution you enter will be used to set the width and height of the encoder image.  Select the file format
as either GIF, JPEG, or PNG.</p>
<p>Next, a file chooser dialog will appear.  Select the directory/folder where you want to store the
    image and type in the filename.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>On <strong>Windows</strong>, you don't need to enter a file extension. If you enter a file extension it needs to match
    the file format you selected in the export dialog.</p>
<p>On <strong>Mac OS X</strong>, it's best if you simply enter the filename without an extension. If you do enter an extension,
    it needs to match the file format you previously selected. Use <code>.png</code> if you
    selected the PNG file format, <code>.jpg</code> for JPEG, and <code>.gif</code> for GIF.</p>
